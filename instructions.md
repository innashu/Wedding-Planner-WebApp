We're building a wedding planner tool! You can get all the context by reading prd.md

We're using Instant as our database! Make sure to read AGENTS.md to understand how to use Instant

We are implementing things in phases. Be sure to read phases.md to understand the outline of the project

Before implementing, write a spec for this phase and save it to `specs/phase2.md`. Wait for my approval before building anything.
