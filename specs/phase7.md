### Current Month Highlighting

- Current month (based on US PST timezone) has a highlighted background
- Badge showing "★ Current Month" or similar indicator
- Auto-expanded on page load

### Month Header

Each month shows:
- Month name and year (e.g., "February 2026")
- Countdown badge (e.g., "9 MONTHS", "3 MONTHS", "WEDDING")
- Collapse/expand chevron

### Task Display

Tasks within each month are grouped by category:
- Category headers in bold
- Tasks as bullet points with checkbox circles
- **Tasks are fully editable:**
  - Click task text to edit inline
  - Hover reveals delete (×) button
  - "Add task" button at bottom of each category
  - Checkbox to mark task as completed (strikethrough when done)

### Interactions

1. **Add Task:** Click "+ Add task" at bottom of any category → inline input appears → type task → press Enter to save
2. **Edit Task:** Click on task text → becomes editable input → press Enter to save or Escape to cancel
3. **Delete Task:** Hover over task → × button appears on right → click to delete (no confirmation needed)
4. **Complete Task:** Click checkbox → task text gets strikethrough → checkbox fills in
5. **Expand/Collapse Month:** Click month header or chevron → toggles visibility of tasks

### Styling

- **Current month card:** `bg-rose-50 border-rose-200 border-2`
- **Other month cards:** `bg-white border-gray-200`
- **Month header:** `font-bold text-lg`
- **Countdown badge:** `bg-rose-100 text-rose-700 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm`
- **Wedding month badge:** `bg-rose-500 text-white`
- **Category header:** `font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4 mb-2`
- **Task item:** `text-gray-600 ml-4`

## Data Structure

### Database Schema

Timeline tasks are stored in InstantDB to allow add/edit/delete operations.

**Add to `instant.schema.ts`:**

```typescript
timelineTasks: i.entity({
  text: i.string(),
  month: i.number().indexed(),      // 1-12
  year: i.number().indexed(),       // 2026
  category: i.string().indexed(),   // "venue", "guests", "ceremony", "personal", "todo"
  completed: i.boolean(),
  order: i.number().indexed(),
  createdAt: i.number(),
})
```

### Seed Data File

Create `src/lib/timelineData.ts` with the initial suggested tasks (used for seeding on first load):

```typescript
interface TimelineTaskSeed {
  text: string;
  category: string;  // "venue", "guests", "ceremony", "personal", "todo"
}

interface TimelineMonthSeed {
  month: number;      // 1-12
  year: number;       // 2026
  tasks: TimelineTaskSeed[];
}

// Export seed data for initial population
export const timelineSeedData: TimelineMonthSeed[] = [...]
```

### First-Load Seeding Logic

On first page load, check if `timelineTasks` collection is empty:
- If empty: populate with seed data from `timelineData.ts`
- If not empty: use existing user data

This allows users to start with researched suggestions but fully customize after.

### Utility Functions

```typescript
// Get current month in PST timezone
function getCurrentMonthPST(): { month: number; year: number }

// Check if a month is the current month
function isCurrentMonth(month: number, year: number): boolean

// Generate month display name
function getMonthDisplayName(month: number, year: number): string

// Generate countdown label
function getCountdownLabel(monthsOut: number, isWeddingMonth: boolean): string
```

## Components

### `TimelinePage.tsx`
- Main page component for `/timeline` route
- Gets current date in PST timezone
- Queries all `timelineTasks` from InstantDB
- Groups tasks by month/year, then by category
- On first load: seeds database if empty
- Renders list of `TimelineMonth` components
- Current month auto-expanded, others collapsed

### `TimelineMonth.tsx`
- Collapsible month card
- Props: `month`, `year`, `tasks`, `isCurrentMonth`, `isExpanded`, `onToggle`
- Renders month header with countdown badge
- Renders `TimelineCategory` components when expanded

### `TimelineCategory.tsx`
- Category grouping component
- Props: `name`, `categoryKey`, `tasks`, `month`, `year`
- Renders category header and task list
- Has "Add task" input at bottom
- Handles creating new tasks

### `TimelineTask.tsx`
- Individual task item with full CRUD
- Props: `task` (from DB)
- Checkbox for completion toggle
- Click text to edit inline
- Delete button on hover
- Updates InstantDB on changes

## File Changes

1. **Modify:** `instant.schema.ts` - Add timelineTasks entity
2. **New:** `src/lib/timelineData.ts` - Seed data and utility functions
3. **New:** `src/components/TimelineTask.tsx` - Editable task row
4. **New:** `src/components/TimelineCategory.tsx` - Category grouping with add task
5. **New:** `src/components/TimelineMonth.tsx` - Collapsible month card
6. **New:** `src/components/TimelinePage.tsx` - Main timeline page with seeding
7. **New:** `src/app/timeline/page.tsx` - Route page
8. **Modify:** `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Add Timeline tab

## Navigation Update

Add Timeline tab to navigation:
- Position: After "To-Do List" (last position) OR as a prominent tab
- Icon suggestion: 📅 or calendar icon
- Label: "Timeline"

New order: Venue & Vendors, Guests, Ceremony, Personal, To-Do List, Timeline

## Implementation Steps

1. Update `instant.schema.ts`
   - Add `timelineTasks` entity with fields: text, month, year, category, completed, order, createdAt
   - Push schema changes to InstantDB

2. Create `src/lib/timelineData.ts`
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for seed data
   - Add all month-by-month task data from research above
   - Add utility functions for PST date handling
   - Export seed data array

3. Create `src/components/TimelineTask.tsx`
   - Checkbox for completion
   - Editable text (click to edit)
   - Delete button (hover to show)
   - InstantDB transactions for updates

4. Create `src/components/TimelineCategory.tsx`
   - Category header
   - List of TimelineTask components
   - "Add task" input at bottom
   - InstantDB transaction for creating new tasks

5. Create `src/components/TimelineMonth.tsx`
   - Collapsible card with month header
   - Countdown badge
   - Current month highlighting
   - Expand/collapse functionality
   - Groups tasks by category

6. Create `src/components/TimelinePage.tsx`
   - Query timelineTasks from InstantDB
   - Get current month in PST
   - Seed database on first load if empty
   - Render all months (Feb-Nov 2026)
   - Auto-expand current month

7. Create `src/app/timeline/page.tsx`
   - Simple route wrapper for TimelinePage

8. Update `src/components/Navigation.tsx`
   - Add Timeline tab with calendar icon

## Verification

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to Timeline tab
3. Verify all 10 months displayed (February - November 2026)
4. Verify February 2026 is highlighted as current month
5. Verify February is auto-expanded on page load
6. Click to expand/collapse other months
7. Verify correct tasks appear in each month (seeded from research)
8. Verify correct categories within each month
9. Verify countdown badges show correct values (9 MONTHS, 8 MONTHS, etc.)
10. Verify November shows "WEDDING" badge
11. **Add task:** Click "+ Add task" → type "Test task" → press Enter → task appears
12. **Edit task:** Click on a task text → edit it → press Enter → change persists
13. **Delete task:** Hover over task → click × → task removed
14. **Complete task:** Click checkbox → task gets strikethrough
15. Refresh page → all changes should persist
16. Verify responsive design on mobile

## Edge Cases

- **Date boundary:** Use PST timezone consistently (Pacific Standard Time / America/Los_Angeles)
- **Month transitions:** Page should update when month changes (user can refresh)
- **Wedding month:** Special styling and content for November 2026
- **Collapsed state:** Months remember their expanded/collapsed state during session
- **Mobile:** Cards should be full-width and easily tappable to expand
- **Empty task:** Don't allow saving empty task text
- **First load seeding:** Only seed if timelineTasks collection is completely empty
- **Edit cancel:** Pressing Escape while editing reverts to original text
- **Delete all tasks:** Category still shows with just "+ Add task" button
- **Long task text:** Text should wrap, not overflow

## Future Enhancements (Not in Phase 7)

- Link timeline tasks to actual items in other categories
- Sync with user's actual progress in other tabs
- Drag-and-drop reordering of tasks
- Move tasks between months
- Email/notification reminders based on timeline
- Reset to suggested tasks button (re-seed)
