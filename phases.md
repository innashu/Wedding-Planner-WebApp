Phases

[X] 1. Set up basic navigation with 5 category tabs (Venue & Vendors, Guests, Ceremony, To-Do List, Other). Each tab shows an empty page with its name. No login needed for MVP.

[X] 2. Implement adding items to any category. Each category page should have a simple way to add items with a name. Items display as a clean list.

[X] 3. Implement expanding items into sub-items. Clicking an item should let me add sub-items underneath it. Keep the UI minimal - just indented text.

[X] 4. Add suggested steps for complex items. When I add items like "Wedding Dress" or "Ketubah", prompt "Add suggested steps?" If yes, populate with actionable steps in logical order (e.g., Research shops → Book appointments → Try on → Choose → Order veil → Alterations → Final fitting). Steps are reorderable.

[X] 5. Implement checking off items and sub-items. I should be able to mark things as done. Completed items should be visually distinct but still visible.

[X] 6. Add the To-Do List view. This should let me add standalone categories with tasks.
