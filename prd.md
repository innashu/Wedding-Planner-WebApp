Problem: I want a simple tool that will help me plan my wedding. I want it to be comprehensive enough to make sure I don't forget anything. However, I dont want it to be overwhelming. The design must be simple and easy to read and use. 

Wedding Details:
- 150 guests
- Location: Bay Area, CA, USA
- Date: November 8, 2026
- Jewish ceremony (not overly religious, but want to honor traditions properly)

Core Structure:
- Separate pages for each planning category
- Each category has high-level goals; can expand into actionable sub-tasks if requested

Planning Categories (5 top-level, with flexible drill-down)
1. Venue & Vendors - venue, photography, music, florist
2. Guests - guest list, RSVPs, seating, accommodations
3. Ceremony - Jewish traditions with explanations, officiant, ketubah, chuppah
4. To-Do List - simple tasks manually added
5. Personal - wedding dress shopping, etc

Flexible Detail Levels with Suggestion
- Each item can have as many or as few sub-items as needed
- Complex items come with suggested sub-items you can adopt or ignore
  - Example: Attire → Dress comes with suggestions: [Veil, Alterations, Accessories, Shoes]
- You can always add your own custom sub-items too

Opportunity: This will be my one stop shop for accessing wedding information.
Everything in one place, suggested next steps when I need them, and the confidence that nothing important is slipping through the cracks.
